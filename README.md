# HealIQ

**HealIQ** is a smart spell suggestion addon for Restoration Druids in World of Warcraft. It helps you prioritize your next healing spell based on current combat context, active HoTs, procs, and cooldowns.

## üß† What It Does

- Displays optimal healing spell suggestions based on Wowhead Restoration Druid guide
- Tracks HoT durations (e.g. Lifebloom, Rejuvenation)
- Recognizes Clearcasting procs and emergency situations
- Shows Swiftmend combo opportunities and AoE healing priorities
- Alerts for cooldown-based healing (e.g. Wild Growth, Tranquility)
- Supports movement and configuration of suggestion UI
- Shows upcoming suggestions in a queue display
- Provides extensive strategy customization options

**Enhanced Strategy Features:**
- Efflorescence maintenance prioritization
- Smart Lifebloom tank management with bloom timing
- Clearcasting proc optimization
- Swiftmend + Wild Growth combo suggestions
- Grove Guardians charge pooling
- Wrath filler for mana restoration
- Configurable thresholds for all healing decisions

**Note:** HealIQ provides visual suggestions only. Due to Blizzard restrictions, spell casting must be done manually using your normal keybinds or action bars.

> HealIQ is inspired by Hekili, but for healing. Designed with Restoration Druids in mind, support for other healers may be added later.

## üõ† For Developers

This addon is written in Lua using the WoW AddOn API.

### Development Setup

1. **Quick Setup:**
   ```bash
   ./setup-dev.sh
   ```
   This script will install Lua, luacheck, and set up the development environment.

2. **Manual Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt-get install lua5.1 luarocks
   sudo luarocks install luacheck
   
   # Or on macOS with Homebrew
   brew install lua luarocks
   luarocks install luacheck
   ```

### Code Quality

This project uses automated linting to catch issues early:

- **Pre-commit hooks** automatically run luacheck before each commit
- **CI/CD pipeline** runs comprehensive linting on all pull requests
- **Local linting:** Run `luacheck *.lua` to check your code

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the main test suite
lua5.1 test_runner.lua

# Run basic validation
lua5.1 Tests.lua

# Run loading order tests (regression test for issue #98)
lua5.1 test_loading_order.lua
```

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes (linting will run automatically on commit)
4. Run tests: `lua5.1 test_runner.lua`
5. Submit a pull request

The pre-commit hook will prevent commits with linting issues. To bypass temporarily (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`
